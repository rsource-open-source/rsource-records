# rsource-records

rsource-records is a discord bot used to fetch information from the Roblox bhop & surf games via the [StrafesNET API](https://api.strafes.net/). This aims to be a bot that has many more features than just an API fetcher in the future.

rsource-records is switching to [detritus](https://github.com/detritusjs/client)! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³
